I enjoy watching anime shows and regular television. I also like to play video games from time to time.
Painting and drawing is something that I do all the time. Listening to music is another thing that I do in my free time.
I enjoy playing the trumpet and to sing. Traveling is something that I enjoy when we go to new places that we havent been to before. 
My favortie food is any food that tastes good, and looking at different cultures to learn from them.
